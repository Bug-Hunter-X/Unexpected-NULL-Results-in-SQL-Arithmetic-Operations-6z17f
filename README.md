This repository demonstrates a common SQL error involving NULL values in arithmetic operations.  The `bug.sql` file contains a query that produces unexpected NULL results due to unhandled NULL values. The `bugSolution.sql` file shows how to correct the query using COALESCE to provide default values for NULLs, resulting in accurate calculations. The README explains the nature of the error, why it occurs and how it is fixed.
